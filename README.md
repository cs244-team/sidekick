## Sidekick

In order to reproduce the results of our replication, upload the `src/`, `util/`, and `scripts/` directories to your nearest Google Cloud server and
install all the necessary dependancies outlined above within the server. 

Run `scripts/run_server.sh` to listen for incoming packets over the WebRTC protocol and aggregate packets into the de-jitter buffer.

Run `scripts/run_proxy` to run the sidekick proxy from the Raspberry Pi to send quACKs to the client. 

Run `scripts/run_client.sh` to send outgoing packets to the server from your local laptop.

The results will be dumped into a csv file for further examination.
