To reproduce the results of our replication, follow these steps:

1. Upload the `src/`, `util/`, and `scripts/` directories to your nearest Google Cloud server.
2. Install all the necessary dependencies outlined in the setup section on the server.
3. Run `scripts/run_server.sh` to listen for incoming packets over the WebRTC protocol and aggregate packets into the de-jitter buffer.
4. Run `scripts/run_proxy.sh` to run the sidekick proxy from the Raspberry Pi to send quACKs to the client.
5. Run `scripts/run_client.sh` to send outgoing packets to the server from your local laptop.

The results will be dumped into a CSV file for further examination.
